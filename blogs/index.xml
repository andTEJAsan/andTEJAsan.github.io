      <description>Status Quo Over the past one and a half month, I have been living in kyoto as a research intern at Kyoto University. I was among the lucky 18 students selected from the IITs for the KU-STAR (Kyoto University Short Term Academic Research Program).
I have been working with Professor Kohei Suenaga in Professor Atsushi Igarashi&amp;rsquo;s Lab in the Graduate School of Informatics.

      <description>Introduction Are you hearing this term for the first time ? Or maybe you&amp;rsquo;ve heard it before but never really understood it ? Or maybe you&amp;rsquo;ve banged your head against the wall trying to understand it numerous times ?
Well, you&amp;rsquo;re in luck. This post is for you.
Condition variables are a synchronization primitive in POSIX (Portable Operating System Interface) systems that allow threads to wait for certain conditions to become true.</description>

      <description>Another phase of my life has ended. Let’s think about what every moment felt like.
Right now, I’m sitting in a bus to Oakwood Hotel, and I took a quick peek inside my mind, wondering, “What did it feel like?” And what’s the answer I got? A void. That’s right, a void.
Some of you (if you are reading this, understand that you are a statistical anomaly among the people who are my “acquaintances”) might be wondering how I could feel a void when everything seems alright in my life.</description>
