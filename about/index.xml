      <description>If you want to know me, this is the correct place to be. First of all I understand that you must be having some preconceived notion of what kind of a human being I am. But the human mind is so complex even the thought of having a preconceived notion seems funny to me.
What fascinates me is the fact that we are all so different from each other. We all have our own unique experiences, our own unique way of looking at the world.</description>
